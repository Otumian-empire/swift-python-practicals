""" Analyse and design a solution for the following problems.

1. Given that a quadratic equation is of the form, Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 , where A , B , C are real parameters such that A , B is not zero. A and B are the co-efficients of x , of second and first degrees respectively and c a constant. Find and output the roots of the quadratic equation.

2. Find the Area of a circle of radius, r , given that PI is 3.143 .

3. A shop keeper sold an item of cost, $340.00 at $372.99 including a tax of $2.99 .find the

    b. profit made
    c. profit percentage
