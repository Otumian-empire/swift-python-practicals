    * write a lift off program using a for loop

    * Given a list of alphabets, from a - z , 
    use a loop to print out the vowels 
    ( Tips: list of vowels, loop, condition )

    * Write a program that simulates the rolling of a dice.
    A fair dice has 6 sides numbered from 1 to 6.
    Take an integer input from the user as the number of 
    times the dice must be rolled and this value must be 
    greater than 50.

    Using a loop ( any loop ) and an if , elif 
    and else statement ( if necessary) and then
     print the number of times a particular number 
    was obtained when the dice was rolled.
