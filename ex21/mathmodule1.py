""" 
As practice project, write a script, mathsmodule.py that performs mathemathical operations such as addition, subtracion, etc. Use a class and create a test.py script then import it there. Our module should pass these test.

Assume that the method names will include, add, subtr, mult, div, floor_div, pow, mod . Add comments and then create a new file, mathsmodule.md - this can by a .txt file too. The documentation, should have information about the developer, what the module is about, how to use the module, how and what to improve, how the methods work and how to use the methods, some errors we expect to occur, some constants that were used, etc. We hope this is becoming clear.

    test add
        add(1,2) = 3
        add(1,-2) = -1
        add(1,2,3,4) = 10

    test subtr
        subtr(1,2) = -1
        subtr(1,-2) = 3

    test mult
        add(1,2) = 2
        add(1,-2) = -2
        add(1,2,4) = 8

    test div
        div(1,2) = 0.5
        div(1,-2) = -0.5
        div(5, 0) = None

    test floor_div
        floor_div(1,2) = 0
        floor_div(1,-2) = -1
        floor_div(1,2,3,4) = 10

    test pow
        pow(1,2) = 1
        pow(2,3) = 8
        pow(2,-2) = 0.25

    test mod
        mod(1,2) = 1
        mod(22,7) = 1
