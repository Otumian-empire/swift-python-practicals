'''
Write a program that checks if a given integer input is a multiple
of 2, 3 or both 2 and 3 and then print what multiple it is with the input.

# the code should behave this way

# input = 4
# output = 4 is a multitple of 2

# input = 6
# output = 6 is a multitple of 2 and 3

# input = 9
# output = 9 is a multitple of 3

# input = 18
# output = 18 is a multitple of 2 and 3
